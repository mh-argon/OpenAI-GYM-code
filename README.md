# OpenAI-GYM-code

To run the code, please use Jupyter notebook, the language is in python 3 so make sure that is selected. 
Most of the code was used from the linked locatons which run through the tutorial of how these concepts worked. 
There are some slight changes but the code is theres due to the nature of a tutorial. 
If you must install jupyter notebooks you should use anaconda to install it, as its a easier method than going through the cmd

Within this repository there are two main files, the python file uses jupyter notebook but has easier to read code, whereas the code text file may be harder to read but is more accessible. 

Again please use jupyter notebooks or other pyhton 3 websites with regards to possible splitting of internal methods and functions, otherwise it may be mroe difficult to read the code in the text file iteslf.
